## The Ashen Wastes

Long ago, The Ashen Wastes were home to a vibrant [republic](/warhammers/aos/setting/calyster/nations/meredia/old-meredia.html) of free confederated cities, wealthy with trade and industry, rich in culture. It all came to an end as the two neighbouring Kingdoms used the lands of the Republic as a buffer zone to battle between themselves, and then slowly laid waste to the surviving people and cities of the magical apocalypse that they unleashed. 
Dense forests, crystal-clear rivers and bountiful fields were transformed into a desolate barren land by the effects of the war, and its people were enslaved, hunted and exploited for profit and pleasure.

Many centuries after the war, the only people left are warrior tribes, raiders that roam the land, eager to serve the will of the Blood God.For only the most savage survive in this toxic and ashen waste of a land. 

## The Waste Walkers

Eight are the great tribes that roam the wastes, warring between themselves as much as raiding the lands outside of the borders of the old nation, where they overspill like locusts every generation. Each tribe is a war host, a finely tuned engine of destruction and death leaded by the most powerful of warriors, seeking the glory that only the Blood God can bestow upon them. For them, the wastes is an arena where only the greatest can survive and where the ultimate prize is for the taking.

Of the height, one has risen to prominence. The Nalem tribe, led by Marrok, the Great Uniter, War Chief of the Ashen Wastes. Every tribe has pledged loyalty and compliance to him after a long and gruelling campaign all over the wastes. A feat that no other tribe has achieved before.

### The Nalem Tribe

From the Ashen Hold, a fortress of brass amidst a raging volcano that spews most of the ashes that give name to the land, the Great Uniter prepares his armies to drench Calyster in blood, the concluding act to a long and bloody war battled across the wastes from which he hopes to obtain Ascension, the final blessing of the Blood God for his greatest champions.
The Nalem boast the better equipped warriors of all the tribes of the wastes. The industrious labour and suffering of thousand of slaves - worked to death in the forges of the Ashen Vault, fuelled by the fire and heat of the mountain into which the city-fortress expands- outputs an uninterrupted stream of iron and brass armours and weapons for the war hosts of the Ashen War Chief and its tributary tribes.

Although the latest leader, Marrok, is the one to have united the tribes, it has done so from a foundation of strength and power that is the heritage of the Nalem. A disciplined if savage force that shows that serving Khorne does not imply losing all sense of strategy or tactics to the rage and blood lust that the followers of the Lord of Skulls usually abandon themselves to.
