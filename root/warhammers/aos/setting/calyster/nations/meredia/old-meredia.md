# The old Republic of Meredia

{% include expandable_image.html src="republic_of_meredia_map.jpg" alt="The Old Republic of Meredia map" class="calyster-map"  %}

Once, the gigantic banners of the Republic of Meredia flapped proudly with the strong and cold winds coming down from the mountain range of Sylcar. A bastion of strength and enlightenment that radiated the light of knowledge and progress during the now long forgotten Age of Myth.

Many were the cities of the Republic, following the path the of the Reyne river up to the Pacific Bay. The great city port of Roda was the focal point of trade through which massive trading fleets conducted commerce between the many different kingdoms and nations of the southern continents of Aqshy.

More a federation of cities that collaborated under a central government than a unified country, the Republic of Meredia was a good example of what can be achieved when every person works to the betterment of the all, from the lowly peasants that harvested the fruits of the land to the High Senators that debated the laws of the Nation.
Each city had it’s own local government and culture, even though the common ideals of freedom and progress were uphold in all of them.

Not a big piece of land compared to its neighbours, the Republic always tried to bound the surrounding kingdoms with trade and a common wealth that would align the interests of everyone into not destroying that link. Where common interest was not enough, the cities would play the diplomatic game to distract, misdirect or present enough of a threat to prevent invasions., maintaining a neutral facade. 

The Republic ended up in an Alliance with it’s sister republic to the north, the Republic of Varna, while playing the neighbour kingdoms of Aras and Ahzshizaar against each other, a strategy that would prove to be its undoing, in the end.

## Cities of Meredia

### Roda

Chiefly among the big cities of Meredia was the port city of Roda, made rich with the commerce that came from many different places of the realm, including the Great Parch, to the north. An intersection of cultures and religions, many were the wonders and events of culture that the citizenry could enjoy, funded by the  Houses of Commerce that were the governing body of the city. Huge markets could be found in the plazas of the city, where merchants from all over the realm would conduct their trade. 

The Fleet of the Houses protected the pacific bay from pirates and raiders, although it was never powerful enough to stop the neighbouring kingdoms from blockading it if they put enough resources.
As for land forces, they felt safe enough with a mercenary force and some militia to protect the peace of the city. When war came and the federated cities of the republic mustered their forces to defend their lands, the city of Roda would contribute mercenaries as well as the part of the fleet that could navigate the Reyne river.

After a long blockade maintained by the Royal Fleet, Roda was, in the end, the city were the fiercest clash between the two rival armies of the Kingdom of Aras and the Silver Covenants happened. Rather than losing the city, the forces of Shublai, the Everstorm wizard, from the seventh Silver Tower, unleashed an apocalyptic magical storm that burned most of the city as well as the defending army from the Kingdom of Aras. Shortly after that, a treaty was signed between the two powers, to share what remained of the country between themselves establishing the frontier to the Reyne river.

### Desou

An agricultural city, the lands surrounding the city were plentiful oceans of wheat and other cereals  giving the city the sobriquet of the Golden city. Not only cereals but also cattle, and all kind of animals would be farmed. The region surrounding Desou was the bread basket of the republic. Before the confederation was founded, this land would see the most amount of battles to conquer it, for it was the most fertile and rich lands that could be found in the country.

Safe inside the republic, the city could specialize into the agricultural industry, producing all kind of food derivatives like wine, cheese, cold cuts of meat, and exotic alcohols that would be traded in all the cities reachable by river, and beyond. The traders of Desou would even sell beyond its borders, to the cities of the Varna Republic along the river, to the north.

Desou was the first time that two armies from the Kingdom of Aras and the Silver Covenants met in battle during the War of the Wastes. The whole city was burnt to the ground, sealing the fate of Meredia, cut short from it's bread basket.

### Namerle

So named the city of crossroads, for it sat at the juncture of several trade routes, connecting the eastern side of Meredia with the western side, acting as a trading post for the traders of the Republic of Varna, the Kingdom of Aras and the Silver Covenants of the east. It prided itself on being the second most important city of the republic, after Roda.

Being the recipient of many invasions over its lifetime, the city had an army more than prepared to defend its territory. A strong and proud military tradition that ensured that citizens would be ready to defend themselves, as well as an industry that provided weapons and supplies, made possible with the wealth that the city's commerce enabled.

It was from Namerle that the Great Republican Army was gathered and armed to defend Meredia when the War of the Wastes came. From this city was organised the defence of the nation. When the republican army was defeated at the place now known as the Blood Scar, it was here that it took haven, to initiate a resistance force that would try to take back the country from the conquerors.


### Vanne

Close to the southern border to the Kingdom of Aras, Vanne was a city of refinement and culture. Traders from the neighbouring kingdom would stop by Vanne on the way to Roda, to barter in the latest gossip of the court and its ludicrous fashion trends (which, in turn, would inspire their Vanne's own ludicrous fashion trends).

Many inhabitants of Vanne would be immigrants from Aras that would favour the greater personal liberties that a republic could offer compared to a Kingdom, but would still feel nostalgia for the grandeur of the old kingdom, if often times it would be a rose-tinted glass view of it, forgetting the reasons they chose to leave the country with time in the first place. Indeed, children and grandchildren of these immigrants would sometimes try to come back to their roots only to return after suffering for themselves the authentic experience of living under the absolute laws and oppression of the Kingdom.

The people of Vanne were proud of their history and even if it was not the richest city of the federation, or the strongest one, they could still boast about its remarkable universities, philosophers, poets and the great textile industry that provided much of the clothes, tapestries and furniture for most of the country and beyond. There were many services that would cater to the rich and refined people of the city, which tended to attract the rich class of other cities and made of Vanne a second city for most of them.
Due to that fact, Vanne was the second political capital of the federation, and many important business and political deals would be made from the sumptuous villas, restaurants and baths of the city.

Vanne was quickly captured in the first stages of the War of the Wastes by the Kingdom of Aras, and the horrors that they suffered under the administration of the Kingdom would be unspeakable.

### Rouatu

An important city near the frontier with the Silver Covenants. The main source of wealth for this city came with the trade with both the Varna's cities to the north -big caravans travelling through the republican road- and with the frontier trade posts in the border of the Covenants territory. Rouatu also held a secret slaving marketplace, captured people either being sold in the city itself or sent abroad, mainly to Ahzshizaar to feed the terrible experiments of the Three Spires.

During the war of the wastes, the town served as the staging base for the Covenants armies. The population of the city, high and low, was exploited and then transformed into monsters and abominations to serve as shock troops against the Royal Army of Aras.

## The war of the wastes

### Garish's Blunder

Throughout the centuries, the cities of the republic banded together to defend themselves against the encroaching of its neighbours. Although each city had its own ideology, they worked and prospered together. The republican armies would be enough to deter any of surrounding kingdoms from invading their lands, the cost of war being too high to make it worth it. In addition to this deterrence, the republic developed an active diplomacy force to contain, subvert and trade away the aggressiveness of its potential enemies.

For a long time, this strategy served them well. 

Garish was a man of resources and contacts, a scion of one of the most powerful Houses in Roda. A high official of the Republic, serving as a diplomat for Meredia in Zyjin. Alarmed by a build-up of the Kingdom's military forces, and what its contacts hinted to be the preparation for an invasion to the republic, the diplomat prepared a plan that would redirect those war preparations and resources or even stop them altogether.

He prepared a grand espionage operation, making use of a vast network of informants and undercover agents inside the court to provide false information to High King Vetzjira about a potential attack from the Silver Covenants to the kingdom. Tensions had been running high between the two countries for decades now, and the thread would be credible enough that the king would divert its resources into preparing a defence of its realm rather than attacking the republic. And, in turn, it could use this preparation to warn the Covenant Lords of a potential attack, which would make them prepare for it, which would reinforce the information coming to the High King. Then the republic could offer itself as a peace broker, perhaps even bolstering trade between the two enemies as a way to ensure that peace, and the republic would be right in the middle of this trade.
A risky plan but sound, in the mind of the diplomat, to both stave off the kingdom's aggression and increase the wealth of the republic.

During the last decades, the monarch of Aras and the Magi Lords of the Covenants had been bolstering their military might and resources, sensing danger from the nations of the north. Centuries of peace and prosperity were coming to an end, a great struggle prophesied by seers, oracles and savants of the continent of Calyster, although no one could say the reason for it. 
As happens when powerful rulers have an army bigger than it needs to be and there are no conflicts, this arming race shaped the ambitions and desires of the two nations, who now were looking for expansion, confident of their strength.
Garish's spy craft incited the two nations to declare war on each other, each of them itching for an opportunity to gain glory, territory and crush a bitter rival. The diplomat's gambit had failed although not completely, since at least the resources of the two neighbours would be put towards each other instead of against Meredia, and perhaps there was an opportunity to provide weapons and provisions to both sides. 
Garish was commended by the council of the republic for handling the situation successfully and in benefit of the Republic.

### The Kingdom of Aras advances

It was with complete horror that the Republic received the news that the city of Vanne was occupied by the Executor General Sarin von Krast, commander of the vanguard forces of the Royal Army of Aras. It seemed that the Kingdom of Aras would take by force the Republic to be able to get to lands of the Silver Covenants, instead of going by boat, or asking for right of passage, as the Council thought would happen.

The city was taken by treachery and deception, the general using a visit to the city to infiltrate its agents at key points of the city and sabotaging the militia of the city before quickly overwhelming the defences in an orchestrated attack. Although it was not known at the time, terrible acts were performed during the taking of Vanne. Its people used in grueling spectacles and senseless violence, debasing acts that stripped of humanity both the victims and the torturers. These acts were
performed for days before the vanguard moved on and let the rest of the Royal Army hold the city and advance. The worst things happened in the city for the rest of the war.
