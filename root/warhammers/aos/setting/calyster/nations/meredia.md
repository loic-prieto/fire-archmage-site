## The Ashen Wastes

The Ashen Wastes are a desolate land, covered by ruins of once great cities, unfortunate bystanders in a proxy war between two rival powers that unleashed a magical cataclysm . It was known during the Age of Myth as the Republic of Meredia, but now only ruins remain of that glorious long ended golden age, and the descendants of those enlightened and industrious people are now marauding, ignorant and barbaric tribes that serve the Blood God.

## The Republic of Meredia

Once, the gigantic banners of the Republic of Meredia flapped proudly with the strong and cold winds coming down from the mountain range of Sylcar. A bastion of strength and enlightenment that radiated the light of knowledge and progress during the now long forgotten Age of Myth.

Many were the cities of the Republic, following the path the of the Reyne river up to the Pacific Bay. The great city port of Roda was the focal point of trade through which massive trading fleets conducted commerce between the many different kingdoms and nations of the southern continents of Aqshy.

More a federation of cities that collaborated under a central government than a unified country, the Republic of Meredia was a good example of what can be achieved when every person works to the betterment of the all, from the lowly peasants that harvested the fruits of the land to the High Senators that debated the laws of the Nation.
Each city had it’s own local government and culture, even though the common ideals of freedom and progress were uphold in all of them.

Not a big piece of land compared to its neighbors, the Republic always tried to bound the surrounding kingdoms with trade and a common wealth that would align the interests of everyone into not destroying that link. Where common interest was not enough, the cities would play the diplomatic game to distract, misdirect or present enough of a threat to prevent invasions., maintaining  neutral facade. 

The Republic ended up in an Alliance with it’s sister republic to the north, the Republic of Varna, while playing the neighbor kingdoms of Aras and Azshijar against each other, a strategy that would prove to be its undoing, in the end.

### Cities of Meredia

#### Roda

Chiefly among them the port city of Roda, made rich with the commerce that came from many different places of the realm, including the Great Parch, to the north. An intersection of cultures and religions, many were the wonders and events of culture that the citizenry could enjoy, funded by the  Houses of Commerce that were the governing body of the city. Huge markets could be found in the plazas of the city, where merchants from all over the realm would conduct their trade. 

The Fleet of the Houses protected the pacific bay from pirates and raiders, although it was never powerful enough to stop the neighboring kingdoms from blockading it if they put enough resources.
As for land forces, they felt safe enough with a mercenary force and some militia to protect the peace of the city. When war came and the federated cities of the republic mustered their forces to defend their lands, the city of Roda would contribute mercenaries as well as the part of the fleet that could navigate the Reyne river.

#### Desou

An agricultural city, the lands surrounding the city were plentiful oceans of wheat and other cereals  giving the city the sobriquet of the Golden city. Not only cereals but also cattle, and all kind of animals would be farmed. The region surrounding Desou was the bread basket of the republic. Before the confederation was founded, this land would see the most amount of battles to conquer it, for it was the most fertile and rich lands that could be found in the country.

Safe inside the republic, the city could specialize into the agricultural industry, producing all kind of food derivatives like wine, cheese, cold cuts of meat, and exotic alcohols that would be traded in all the cities reachable by river, and beyond. The traders of Desou would even sell beyond its borders, to the cities along the river of the Varna Republic, to the north.

When the war between the Kingdoms of Aras and Azshijar blew out, the city of Desou was pillaged and burned to the ground and the city of Roda was blockaded, provoking a collapse of the Republic of Meredia.
